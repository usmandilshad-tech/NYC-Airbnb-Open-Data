# 🏙️ NYC Airbnb EDA

This project explores the NYC Airbnb dataset using pure Python scripts (no Jupyter notebooks).

## 🔍 What’s Included
- Modular scripts for data cleaning, univariate and bivariate EDA
- Output charts saved to `output/charts/`
- Cleaned dataset saved to `output/cleaned_data.csv`

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py

## 📌 **Summary: NYC Airbnb Data Analysis Project**
Project Name: NYC Airbnb EDA using Python Scripts
Role: Data Analyst / Data Scientist
Tools: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), modular scripts, PyCharm Community Edition
Dataset: New York City Airbnb Open Data (Kaggle)

## 🔧 **What I Did**
Cleaned raw Airbnb listing data by handling missing values, converting date formats, and exporting a clean dataset.
Performed univariate analysis to understand distributions (price, room types, boroughs).
Conducted bivariate analysis (price by borough, room type vs. price, correlations).
Saved insights as high-quality charts for sharing and reporting.
Built the entire project using Python .py scripts, not notebooks, to show production-level workflow and IDE compatibility.
Designed a modular project structure with reusable code and output directories.

## 💡 **Skills Demonstrated**
Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis
Modular, scalable Python scripting
Visualization and insight extraction
Project organization for GitHub and production-readiness
